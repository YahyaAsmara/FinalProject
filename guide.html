		<p>This game is a very simple one to understand as it can be described in one sentence.<br><b>Do not tap the white tiles.</b><br> Doing so would lead to your failure. One trick is to get used to your mouse's movements. This would allow you to be more comfortable when aiming, and you will just have to worry about clicking.<br>There are also different mouse grips, and from experience, fingertip grip allows you to move more freely and faster,with the trade off of accuracy. If you are going to start playing the game, it is recommended to turn fullscreen on. <br>The setup would look way better. There are 3 buttons at the page. The first one redirects you to the home page. The second one allows you to choose your own time limit as the default time limit is 30 seconds. The third and last button will start the game; the game will alert you if you click on a white tile when the game has not started yet. <br>If you want to focus on aiming using your mouse and you have a numpad, there is a way to make the clicks come from your mousepad.Just do alt + shift + numlock, and it should enable mouse keys.
